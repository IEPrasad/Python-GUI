  # ** Checkboxes and Radio buttons are both types of GUI elements used for user input in 
  #   graphical user interfaces, but they have different charateristics and use cases:

  #   1: Chekbox:

  #         ** A checkbox is a GUI element that allows users to select or deselect and  
  #             option independently.
          
  #         ** You can have multiple checkboxes in a group, and users can choose any 
  #             combination of options.
          
  #         ** Each checkbox is typically independent of others in the group.
          
  #         ** Checkboxes are suitable when users can choose multiple options simultaneously.


  #   2: Radio Buttons:

  #         ** A radion button, or option button, is a GUI element that presents a set of
  #         mutually exclusive options.

  #         ** Users can choose only one option from the group of radio buttons.

  #         ** When one radion button in a group is selected, it automatically deselecteds
  #             any other radio button in the same group.

  #         ** Radio buttons are suitable when users need to make a single selection
  #             from a set of options.

  # In summary, checkboxes are used when users can make multiple selections from a group 
  # of options, while radio buttons are used when users need to make a single, exclusive   
  # selection from a set of options. The choice between checkboxes and radio buttons depends
  # on the specific requirements of the user interface and the type of input you want to 
  # collect from the user.
